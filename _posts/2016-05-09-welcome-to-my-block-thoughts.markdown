Over this past year, I've served as a member of the Senior Board for *The
Polytechnic*. After a fantastic year, my time as an editor has come to a close.

But, after the elections ended, I realized: I don't want to stop writing. In
fact, I want to write whenever I can. So, welcome to *Thoughts*, where you will
find my thoughts, ideas, or whatever I may feel like talking about. Enjoy!
